# Buildbarn deployment that doesn't use containers

The deployments based on container images allow you to easily spin up a
Buildbarn setup on Linux-based systems. As Buildbarn can also be used on
non-Linux systems, this directory contains scripts for launching
all of Buildbarn's processes directly. This setup uses the following
simplified configuration:

</p>

Buildbarn can be launched by running `bazel run //bare:bare`, which will fetch
and build the different Buildbarn binaries, start them, and load the
configuration found in the `config` directory.

This deployment is known to work on FreeBSD, Linux and macOS.

# Using this deployment with Bazel

In addition to [the generic build options](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments/blob/master/bazelrc),
the following options should be added to `~/.bazelrc`:

```
build:local --config=remote
build:local --jobs=8
build:local --remote_executor=localhost:8980
build:local --remote_instance_name=local
```

Once added, you may perform remote builds against Buildbarn by running
the command below:

```
bazel build --config=local //...
```
